# **Find the optimal route**
The given task is to implement the A* Search in Artificial Intelligence using a the provided files to find the most optimal route.

# **Concepts**
The project focuses on the following concepts:
  A* Search:A* Search Algorithm is a simple and efficient search algorithm that can be used to find the optimal path between two nodes in a graph. 
  It will be used for the shortest path finding. It is an extension of Dijkstra's shortest path algorithm (Dijkstra's Algorithm)
  
# ** Files**
coordinates.txt: Given file that will contain all the coordinates for each city.
main.py: A* Search implementation within the command line that will ask the user for the starting city and ending city
in order to determine the most optimal route.
map.txt: Given file that contains cities neighoring cities and distance in order to determine lowest cost.
